!['Alex's selfie](./me.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

I'm Linhua (Alex) Wang, go by Alex, come from Shenzhen, a modern city in the south of China. I am a Ph.D. student at Baylor College of Medicine currently, and hopefully the next few years. Houston is a cool place for ppl like me. I am a fan of Texas BBQ, come and enjoy it. 

In this blog, I will post my study notes, solutions to technical issues, good or bad memories and etc. Email me if you find anything interesting or useful. &#9786;
