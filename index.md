!['Alex's selfie](./me.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

My name is Linhua (Alex) Wang. I prefer to be called Alex if you don't feel good pronouncing Mandarin. I come from Shenzhen, a modern city in the south of China. I enjoy hotpot, noodles, fried rice, bbq, .... hmm, all kinds of food. I play video games, watch movies and enjoy outdoor activities during my leisure time.  

Starting from July 24th, I will be a Ph.D. student at Baylor College of Medicine. Feeling excited about the life in Houston.

In this blog, I will post my study notes, solutions to technical issues, good or bad memories and etc. Email me if you find anything interesting or useful. &#9786;
