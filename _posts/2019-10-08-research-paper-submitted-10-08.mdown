We submitted a manuscript reporting the Ensemble Integration research that I did at Mount Sinai to Machine Learning in Computational Biology (MLCB 2019). 

Another manuscript titled as "Predicting youth diabetes risk using NHANES data and machine learning" was submitted to Pediatric Diabetes and medRxiv (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19007872v1).

Fingers crossed!
