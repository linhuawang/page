Haven't posted for a long time. Now I'm officially a Ph.D. student at Baylor College of Medicine. I'm close to the end of my first rotation. Surprisingly, the coursework in my first-year graduate life is pretty heavy. The giant biology marathon class took most of my time and I can't spend too much time on research. 

Anyways, I like the life in Houston and enjoy my new role. I enjoy the food here. Houson doesn't have as many food options as New York. But with a car, you can get most food that you want to. I go to gym regularly and tend to build some muscle. Going to have a term break for a week, and will return to school for my second-term rotation and courses.  

Life is beautiful :).
