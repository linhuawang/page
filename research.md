## General Interests

From the career perspective, I like researching computational biology, an interdiscpline involving computer science, biology and mathematics. My professional goal is to build a 'geological map' of health data and intepret it so that health status can be viewed integratively rather than from diverse individual perspectives. 

I believe it can improve our understanding of diseases and help treatments. Just like how google map tells us which route from one place to another is the best in terms of ETA or tolls, eventually, such a integrative system might be able to tell the dynamics of disease formation and the optimal treatments needed for a specific pateint in certain circumstances. 

I'll start my PhD study this Fall. For more information, please look at my <a href="../resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a> or my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/linhuaw/">LinkedIn</a> page.

**Abstract:** Heterogeneous ensembles are an effective approach in scenarios where the ideal data type and/or individual predictor are unclear for a given problem. These ensembles have shown promise for protein function prediction (PFP), but their ability to improve PFP at a large scale is unclear. The overall goal of this study is to critically assess this ability of a variety of heterogeneous ensemble methods across a multitude of functional terms, proteins and organisms. Our results show that these methods, especially Stacking using Logistic Regression, indeed produce more accurate predictions for a variety of Gene Ontology terms differing in size and specificity. To enable the application of these methods to other related problems, we have publicly shared the HPC-enabled code underlying this work as LargeGOPred (https://github.com/GauravPandeyLab/LargeGOPred).<br/>
