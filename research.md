From the career perspective, I like researching computational biology, an interdiscpline involving computer science, biology and mathematics. My professional goal is to build a 'geological map' of health data(GMHD) so that health status can be viewed integratively rather than from diverse individual perspectives. I believe it can improve our understanding of diseases and help treatments. Just like how google map tells us which route from one place to another is the best in terms of ETA or tolls, eventually, such a GMHD system might be able to tell the optimal treatments needed for a specific pateint in certain circumstances. I'll start my PhD study this Fall. For more information, please look at my <a href="../resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a> or my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/linhuaw/">LinkedIn</a> page.
